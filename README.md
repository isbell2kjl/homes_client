# HomeClient

Homes_Client is the Angular 18.0 frontend for a real estate tracking application. It interacts with a .NET 8.0 backend connected to a MySQL database, providing a user-friendly interface for managing and tracking real estate properties. This application offers an intuitive solution to record and monitor actions, such as conversations, phone calls, and correspondence with buyers and sellers.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

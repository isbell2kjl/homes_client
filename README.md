# Homes Client

Homes_Client is the Angular 18 frontend for a real estate tracking application. It provides a responsive and user-friendly interface for managing properties, tracking communications, and organizing interactions with buyers and sellers.

The application communicates with a .NET 8.0 backend API and is designed to reflect modern frontend development practices, including secure authentication, reactive forms, and responsive layouts.

# Features

- Built with Angular 18 and Angular Material
- JWT-based authentication with secure session handling
- Reactive forms for data entry and validation
- Responsive layout optimized for desktop and mobile
- Role-based navigation and UI behavior
- Integration with Google reCAPTCHA
- Designed to work with a .NET backend behind Nginx

# Development Notes

This project assumes the backend API is running and accessible.
Environment-specific configuration (API base URLs) should be set using Angular environment files.
